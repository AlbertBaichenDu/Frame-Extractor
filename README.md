# Frame-Extractor
This provides a better solution than ffmpeg to extract exact frame at specific timepoint. The problem with ffmpeg is that it does not handle video frames with high level of accuracy. MoviePy does a much better job.

With some further tweaks, this can also be used to extract frames from multiple videos in a directory. You may refer to my video-clipper repository for how to do that.
